    <h1>8 Steps to Becoming A Successful Tech Entrepreneur</h1>

<h2>There are many ways to become a successful programmer but a Tech Entrepreneur is a bit different. Here are 8 Steps to becoming a successful tech entrepreneur.</h2>
<br>
 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Pure-mathematics-formul%C3%A6-blackboard.jpg" alt="img">
<h3> 1. Math may not be fun but its fundamental</h3>
<br>
<p>
Math is a basic prerequisite to becoming a tech entrepreneur, specifically Calculus or higher. Math is necessary when its comes to algorithms and object oriented programming. <strong>You need to understand the basics so that the process of coding can be a much simpler experience.</strong></p>

<p>
Let’s say you need to find a way to share O(log N) running time with binary search on an ordered array. How can you do that without math? You can’t. So basically, math is a necessary skill.
</p>
<p>
By the way, you would need a Fibonacci search algorithm. Just so you know.
</p>
<p>
Even with money, <a style="color:blue" href="http://85667mwwz2442t66wzujx5np07.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_top">mathematical concepts</a> like finance and algebra can prove to be quite useful.
</p>

       <h3>    2.  Basic knowledge of programming can be useful </h3>

<p>Basic knowledge of programming can be very useful, especially when you are in the Web or App development business. Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript gives you everything you need to build a static website. Learning these three languages should take less than 3 months. <strong>A tip for beginners, create while you are learning</strong>. It is definitely my recommended method to learning how to program. Real life experience can be the best teacher, in fact, there is nothing like it. But if you do not have the time to build your own <a style="color:blue" href="http://23f93gr-0xthut8e-9r6ix9tdf.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_top">web template</a> you can always buy a collective for the price of lunch </p>

            <h3>3.Read Books…...no seriously. Read. Books.</h3>

<p>
If you are any type of entrepreneur, reading is essential. You must learn from your "past" and understand what it truly means to be an entrepreneur. Books were created to be <strong>helpful</strong> and <strong>informative</strong>. Do not take this resource for granted. I personally read 1 book every 2 weeks. One of my favorite books to read and I would highly recommend all entrepreneurs to read is called <a  style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1604598875/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1604598875&linkCode=as2&tag=1670768-20&linkId=4d4bedc39681b5d4e5b22aafb5e12922">The Science Of Getting Rich</i> by Wallace D. Wattles</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=1670768-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1604598875" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. This book will give you everything you need to put you on the path to success for any calling. You can also read <a  style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1514698137/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1514698137&linkCode=as2&tag=1670768-20&linkId=b8736ddfab362440c09afeaded3c0a9e">Napoleon Hill’s <i>Think and Grow Rich</i></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=1670768-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1514698137" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. This book, once understood, can alter the direction of your life forever. I haven’t met one person who have read this book who haven’t been completely moved or inspired. Not one. This book is second to only the bible, no f****ng joke. If you are a person who is dependent on money for life's necessities (which is everyone), this book will give you a guide to riches of your choosing and the results to back it up.</p>

<h3>4.Invest in yourself</h3>
<p>
I can not stress this enough, if you are not willing to invest into yourself then this is not for you. When I say invest in yourself, what do I mean by that? Do what you have to do to get to your goal. Period. Do not lounge around and say “ Oh im tryna be a hacker and make hella bread”. No. You need to go get that sh*t. Invest the necessary time and money to execute your goal. <strong>Your income will always be a reflection of the type of service you render, your ability to do it, and the difficulty in replacing you</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
See there is a misconception that rich people are valuable. Which is completely and clearly wrong once you take a really good look at it. Valuable people are rich, not the other way around. It’s not what your country can do for you, it’s what you can do for your country. So invest in your yourself and become a person of value., the money always follow. Trust me.
</p>
 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Shortcut.png" alt="img">
<h3>5.Realize that there are no shortcuts to greatness</h3>

<p>
This one is the one that I struggled with the most with growing up. I was always trying to find a get rich scheme or fast money ideas. I was always looking for a shortcut until I realized something. If you take a shortcut to your goal, it will only be temporary. Your victory will be short-lived. The only way you can reassure that your goals are not mere fantasy and here to say is if you give it all you got. You can only become the best when you put your best effort in. Like attracts like. It’s just that simple.</p>

<h3>6. Surround yourself with people who have what you want.</h3>

<p>Sometimes we let our circumstances take over our lives and control what direction our lives go. But if you take control of your own life and mind, you start to create the circumstances that are in your favor. The same can be said when you want to surround yourself with successful people. <strong>Make the conscious decision to get to know the type of person you want to become</strong>. Find a mentor. Become an apprentice. This concept is proven to be beneficial to those who sincerely apply it to their lives. Does anyone come into mind?</p>
 <img src="http://www.picserver.org/images/highway/phrases/risk.jpg" alt="img">
<h3> 7. Be prepared to take risks. </h3>

<p>
Every entrepreneur should know how risky it is to be an entrepreneur. There are going to be many nights of failed attempts and countless late nights. It will take a while before you start actually start making some real money. It will take a lot of guts to push through your limits. <strong>But once money start coming in, it will come from so many sources.</strong>  Entrepreneurs makes a lot of profits but where there is profit, there has to be the possibility of losing. If you are prepared for potential loses then you should be fine. Carry on!</p>

<h3> 8. Multiple streams of income </h3>

<p> The best and most reassuring way to build wealth is with passive income. Passive income is income you make over a period of time from work that was done before. <strong>Basically, your goal should be to make money while you are sleeping.</strong> There are many ways to make passive income if you are a tech entrepreneur. You can use:

<p>Affiliate Link</p>
<p>Advertisements on your webpage</p>
<p> Membership or Subscription based website, apps or software</p>
<p> And many more!!!</p>

<p> Start using some of these techniques today!</p>
